# Distributed Technologies
Distributed Technologies is a team working for Energinet, the sole Danish TSO. As a team under the Innovation and Digitalization department, we innovate and experiment with new technologies, as well as develop tools and platforms that will help transition Denmark to sustainable energy. 

This Github organization was created to have a common place for our repositories that are developed open source and we welcome anyone to contribute or give feedback to our code. Since we are a team that works with many different technologies and works in different problem domains, we have created a [wiki](https://github.com/distributed-technologies/wiki) where you can get a full overview of the project we are working on, as well as find information about our development methods. 

## Projects

#### SCCP
One of the projects we are developing is called SCCP, which is a highly available, fast, secure, robust platform which will run future applications for the energy grid in Denmark. If you are visiting this page to try out this platform and develop applications for it, please visit the [Yggdrasil repository](https://github.com/distributed-technologies/yggdrasil) to deploy our platform to Azure in a simple and fast way. 

#### Filemover
The filemover is a project that is currently being developed because the current filemover at Energinet will reach its EOL soon. Currently, a PoC is being developed, which you can find at [here](https://github.com/distributed-technologies/filemover-poc).

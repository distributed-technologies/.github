# Distributed Technologies
Distributed Technologies is a team working for Energinet, the sole Danish TSO. As a team under the Innovation and Digitalization department, we innovate and experiment with new technologies, as well as develop tools and platforms that will help transition Denmark to sustainable energy. We are called Distributed Technologies because we develop distributed systems that are robust, highly available and have the workload distributed across multiple systems or nodes. This is important to the Danish energy sector, because uptime is a very important metric in developing these systems, and the distribution of both workloads as well as data, makes the system more robust. 

This Github organization was created to have a common place for our repositories that are developed open source and we welcome anyone to contribute or give feedback to our code. Since we are a team that works with many different technologies and works in different problem domains, we have created a [documentation repository](https://github.com/distributed-technologies/documentation) where you can get a full overview of the project we are working on, as well as find information about our development methods. 

## License
We publish all our code under the Apache 2.0 license. We use many different open source projects in this organization and we do not overrule their respective licenses. 

## Projects
These are the projects that we as team Distributed Technologies are currently working on. 

#### Secure compute and communications platform (SCCP)
The Secure Compute and Communication Platform (SCCP) project is an attempt at creating a modern, fast, secure, robust, and uniform platform for running a variety of application suites for running and monitoring infrastructure.

If you are visiting this page to try out this platform and develop applications for it, please visit the [Yggdrasil repository](https://github.com/distributed-technologies/yggdrasil) for instructions on how to deploy our platform to Azure in a simple and fast way. 

#### Filemover
The filemover is a project that is currently being developed because the current filemover at Energinet will reach its EOL soon. Currently, a PoC is being developed, which you can find at [here](https://github.com/distributed-technologies/filemover-poc).
